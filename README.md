# LIMS

A full-stack C# WPF project, parsing raw output from LC-MS/MS instrument control software and performing regression analysis. This includes the ability to save and load data within a project structure, manually update regression parameters and exclude data points, and view the calibration curve graphically

The project is designed using MVVM architecture to allow for testability and maintainability. 

## Project Creation
Users can create a project structure using dialogs, with analytical run data stored on the local disk.

## Viewing the Regression Data
Data is imported from a .txt export file generated by the instrument control software, which is then parsed. A regression is then run and the results displayed in a grid. The user can deactivate calibration standard and QC samples to exclude them from the analysis.

## Calibration Curve
The calibration curve is rendered using oxyplot, allowing zoom and pan across the graph.
